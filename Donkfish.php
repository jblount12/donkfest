        <h1>Jason "Ultra Fish" Blount</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p>Jason just might be the 37th greatest poker player ever to come
        out of Raleigh North Carolina. Does he bluff too much? Probably. Does
        he like to raise with A5 suited utg? Yes. Is that a horrible play?
        I believe so but hey who the hell am I? Does he put everyone on Ace King?
        Yes. Does he try to suck out with Ace Queen when he should have folded
        to the 3cbet? Yes. 
        But that's why he is the "Ultra Fish" </p>
        
        
        <h2>Jeff "Tree Fiddy" Keller</h2>
        
        <p>Jeff "Tree Fiddy" Keller could possibly be the best poker player
        to come from Boone, North Carolina....but he isn't. He is a subpar player
        who doesn't get to play enough poker. He doesn't play aggressive enough
        and is always convinced that the other players always have the nuts. Even
        when he is holding the nuts. He might make a decent cash one day, but
        until that happens he will always be looking to barrow a little money
        just like the Lock Ness monster. He just needs about "Tree Fiddy"</p>
