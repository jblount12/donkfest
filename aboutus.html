            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            
            <p>Jason "Ultra Fish" Blount was born on a comet while punching 
            a dinosaur in the late 1980s. He started playing poker after realizing
            he had a slight gambling addiction that he received while hiking in 
            the Andes Mountains with a chimp named Cheeto. Jason has made multiple
            cashes in his poker career. Propelling him to the top 10 poker
            players who no one has ever heard of on a list no one has ever read.</p>

            <h2>Jeff "Tree Fiddy" Keller</h2>
            
            <p>Jeff "Tree Fiddy" Keller wasn't necessarily "born". He actually
            arose from a volcano after running out of chips and salsa. He became
            aware of his gambling problem early in life, after betting kids their
            chocolate milk that he was faster on the playground. (Which he was)
            Sadly his poker play has not lived up to prosperity, having made 
            no real money in his early years he became a baller on a budget. 
            Throwing loose change at sluts. He hopes to change his fortune in 
            2019 when he embarks on a journey to Las Vegas</p>
